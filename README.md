# Bundle-Of-Joy
This mobile application will have a 2-in-1 function for a Mother-to-be as well as for Mother-for-baby.

# Mother-to-be (Semester 1)
This will help mother-to-be with their appointments with gynecologists (private hospitals or government clinics). It also helps to monitor mothers' health, especially the pregnant mothers who have health complications such as hypertension or high sugar level. The app will include a fitness feature to monitor their diet, recommend the exercises they need, etc.

# Mother-for-baby (Semester 2)
From a mother-to-be to mother-for-baby, this app aims to assist mothers to care for their little ones like information on their baby's appointments with paediatrician or government clinics regarding monthly injection, information in the form of chart of growth and diet of child, giving instructions on the dos and don'ts, etc.

Both apps will show the analytic or static interpretation of the monitored children's diet, activities, and so on.
